	<h1> Lab 3 File Structures </h1>
	<p> The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files. </p>
	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> It was easy creating the file structure once I got the hang of it, but I had some difficulty creating index.html files and making them work right. </p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
