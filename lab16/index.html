    <h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs</h1>

      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>Working with your partner, experiment with processing JSON from an API. </p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p> I had to experiment a bit to get document.write() to work. I had some problems with styling, but I solved these by messing experimenting in the Inspector. When I got it right, I copy and pasted into my stylesheet. </p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p> The results speak for themselves in this case, on the index.html
          page. The Program is below.</p>
